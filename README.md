if you have never compiled a wallet in linux before, here are the dependencies you will need:

sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libtool autotools-dev autoconf automake libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libdb5.1-dev libdb5.1++-dev libminiupnpc-dev libdb++-dev qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libminiupnpc8 git

to clone and compile:
git clone https://github.com/doged/dogedsource && cd dogedsource/src && make -f makefile.unix

then ./dogecoindarkd -daemon

(youll get a message telling you to make a conf file)

then make a DogeCoinDark.conf file in the newly created ~/.DogeCoinDark folder 

(its hidden, so use la instead of ls to see it)

example DogeCoinDark.conf:
rpcuser=whateverusername
rpcpassword=whateverpassword
rpcport=20102
port=21102



then go back into the /dogedsource/src folder and "./dogecoindarkd -daemon" again

now just wait for the blockchain to download. you can check status by typing "./dogecoindarkd getinfo" in the dogedsource/src/  directory
